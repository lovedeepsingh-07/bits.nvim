neovim plugins that I like, the way I like them

## dired.nvim (fork)

> [!IMPORTANT] GO TO [X3eRo0/dired.nvim](https://github.com/X3eRo0/dired.nvim)

this is my personal fork of `dired.nvim` plugin, the original plugin can be found at: [X3eRo0/dired.nvim](https://github.com/X3eRo0/dired.nvim), this fork of dired only has some small tweaks that only I prefer, if you want to use dired in neovim please use the one from X3eRo0.
